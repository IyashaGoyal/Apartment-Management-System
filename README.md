## Apartment Management System
This project is a database management system designed to handle various activities of an apartment complex, including resident management, apartment unit management, rent payment tracking, and maintenance request management. It was developed as part of a group project by students of the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology.

## Key Features
Resident Management: Add, update, and delete resident details, including lease information.
Apartment Unit Management: Manage apartment unit details, including size, number of rooms, and rental rate.
Rent Payment Management: Track rent payments, including dates and amounts paid.
Maintenance Request Management: Submit and track maintenance requests.
Reporting: Generate comprehensive reports on rent payments, maintenance requests, and occupancy rates.
Security: Ensure data security with user authentication and authorization.

## Database Design
The project includes the following primary tables:

Building: Stores information about buildings.
Apartment: Stores information about apartment units.
Tenant: Stores information about residents.
Payment: Stores information about rent payments.
The database was normalized to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.

## SQL & PL/SQL Implementation
The system was implemented using SQL and PL/SQL. Key SQL operations include table creation, data insertion, and complex queries to manage and analyze data. Advanced join operations were used for detailed data analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a comprehensive apartment management system, highlighting strong SQL skills and effective collaboration in a group setting. The system facilitates efficient management of apartment complexes by providing essential functionalities and ensuring data integrity.
